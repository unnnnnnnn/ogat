# OGAT

Just a dumb bot where you can get random images from a bank.

You can also **request** images to the bank.

## Commands

* `o!ogat`: Get a random image from the bank.

* `o!get <number>`: Get a specific image.

* `o!request <url>`: Request an image. No NSFW (or you could be blocked from sending images)

* `o!channel`: (Admin only) Set the channel where the bot can send image

## Usage

You need to use the `o!channel` in the channel of your choice to allow the bot to send images.

No images will be allowed to be sent from the bot in other channels.
